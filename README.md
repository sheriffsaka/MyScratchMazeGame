# MyScratchMazeGame
It is a Maze game that featured a cat moving along a path using the keyboards arrow keys (Up, Down, Right and Left) and eating mouses to get more scores as it moves. If touches the red edges 1 point is deducted from the earned score and on getting to the finish point, a message displays YOU WON!!!
